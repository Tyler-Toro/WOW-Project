\\\\Intro:
 A single flash of lightning casts dozens of long shadows across the island. The subsequent thunder crashes, deafening and awaking you at the same time.You wake up and remember nothing....The rain is relentless, making the view in every direction a grey abyss. The only feature made out in the distance, as another flash of lightening blazes across the sky, is the outline of a gigantic building.Someone is shouting over the rain, you're gripping a radio....

####The answers to questions will be taken as user input, more questions to come later most likely. 
####The weapon choice wont matter as far as damage but will add to weight maybe for the rope snap or elevator drop?

 Rain continues to pour in sheets as you head towards the building, looks like an abadoned bioengineering facility. With limited visibility you rush past the deserted security gates and have a choice..

####The user can choose to enter lobby or circle around the facility. If he chooses the latter he runs into some kind of enemy that starts to attack, fights him and upon defeat of the enemy we will reward user with a clue(maybe a memory) or item and have him run into the lobby after the battle. I was thinking that's how we can give clues, in the form of memories coming back to the player and also whenever they solve a puzzle or clue.
